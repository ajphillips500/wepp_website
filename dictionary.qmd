## Simulated Data Set 1

Column $x$ is a random draw from a uniform distribution on the interval $(0,5)$. Column $ytrue$ is generated from the $x$ values with the following function: $$f(x)= \begin{cases}
\frac{7}{3}-\frac{2}{3}x\text{ if } x\leq 2\\
\cos(\pi x)\text{ if } x>2
\end{cases}$$ Column $y$ is the $ytrue$ column plus $N(\mu=0,\sigma^2=0.04)$ random noise.
