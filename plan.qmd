First idea: Compare the fully Bayesian version of iMGPE described by Rasmussen et al. with the partially Bayesian version I have used where the parameters of the GP experts are fit with maximum likelihood estimation.

Second idea: Replace the Modified Chinese Restaurant Process presented by the authors with another, better defined, clustering step such as the Distance Dependent CRP presented by Blei and Frazier.

Third idea: Modify the clustering step or the GP expert step of the iMGPE algorithm to accept categorical variables as covariates.  Experiment with different approaches to find the most reliable and computationally efficient method of incorporating categorical covariate information.
